## Can You Solve The Vexing Vexillology?

### Riddler Express

From Jason Zimba comes a sequence of scrambled screens:

Each of the images below is a different nation’s flag in which the pixels have been randomly rearranged. Can you figure out which flag is which?

_Important note_: Some browsers can distort the colors of the flags. If you’d like to scrutinize these images, consider downloading them first, which you can do by right-clicking each image.

There will be one winner per flag. And if you’re a little rusty on your flags, you can view them all [here](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/docs/flagsoftheworld.html).

**Flag A**

**Flag C**

### Note

The solution I created is overkill and processes all nations' flags.  I used [this repository](https://github.com/hjnilsson/country-flags) as a source of flag images.
