## These Challenges Will Boggle Your Mind

## Riddler Express

What is the longest word you can build in a game of Scrabble one letter at a time? That is, starting with a valid two-letter word, how long a word can you build by playing one letter at a time on either side to form a valid three-letter word, then a valid four-letter word, and so on? (For example, HE could become THE, then THEM, then THEME, then THEMES, for a six-letter result.)

(You can look up [Scrabble words here](http://scrabble.hasbro.com/en-us/tools).)
