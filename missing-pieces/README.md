## Help Us Find These Missing Pieces

### Riddler Express

From Jim Nugent, a piece of a hexagon:

The [regular hexagon](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RegularPolygon.html) below has an area of 1. What is the area of the shaded region?

### Riddler Classic

From Tyler Barron, a snaking circle, via a [problem-solving course](http://www.bu.edu/sed/profile/aaron-brakoniecki/) at Boston University:

The largest circle below has a radius of 10, the medium circle has a radius of 5 and the small, orange circle has a radius of 2. The orange circle crawls counterclockwise along the edge of the largest circle until it meets the medium circle, at which point it crawls up along the edge of the medium circle until it reaches the crest. What is the area of the shaded orange region in the right image?

### Notes

The solution for the Riddler Express relies on recognizing that the shaded area is a regular sub-region of a regular sub-region of the regular hexagon.  The solution for the Riddler Classic just relies on knowledge of circle areas.  This Classic problem would be much harder if the angles weren't all multiples of 180 degrees.
