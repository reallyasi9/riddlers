## Can You Solve The Vexing Vexillology?

### Riddler Classic

The New York Times recently launched some new word puzzles, one of which is [Spelling Bee](https://www.nytimes.com/puzzles/spelling-bee). In this game, seven letters are arranged in a honeycomb lattice, with one letter in the center. Here’s the lattice from December 24, 2019:

(Spelling Bee screenshot, with the required letter G, and the additional letters L, A, P, X, M and E.)

The goal is to identify as many words that meet the following criteria:

  - The word must be at least four letters long.
  - The word must include the central letter.
  - The word cannot include any letter beyond the seven given letters.

Note that letters can be repeated. For example, the words GAME and AMALGAM are both acceptable words. Four-letter words are worth 1 point each, while five-letter words are worth 5 points, six-letter words are worth 6 points, seven-letter words are worth 7 points, etc. Words that use all of the seven letters in the honeycomb are known as “pangrams” and earn 7 bonus points (in addition to the points for the length of the word). So in the above example, MEGAPLEX is worth 15 points.

Which seven-letter honeycomb results in the highest possible game score? To be a valid choice of seven letters, no letter can be repeated, it must not contain the letter S (that would be too easy) and there must be at least one pangram.

For consistency, please use [this word list](https://norvig.com/ngrams/enable1.txt) to check your game score.

_Note_: This is different from The New York Times word list, but please stick to this list for the purposes of the puzzle.
