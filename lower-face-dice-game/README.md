Also from Conor, an impromptu gambling problem:

You and I stumble across a [100-sided die](https://www.google.com/search?q=100+sided+die&safe=off&espv=2&biw=1439&bih=800&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiStObC8rzRAhUqwFQKHUfiClkQ_AUIBygC) in our local game shop. We know we need to have this die — there is no question about it — but we’re not quite sure what to do with it. So we devise a simple game: We keep rolling our new purchase until one roll shows a number smaller than the one before. Suppose I give you a dollar every time you roll. How much money do you expect to win?

Extra credit: What happens to the amount of money as the number of sides increases?

## Author's note

The closed-form solution behind this one is not as easy as the Express version.  This code simply simulates the game and demonstrates the answer.
