## Damn The Torpedoes — Two Puzzles Ahead!

### Riddler Express


From Brett Andersen, some numismatic numerology:

I was recently traveling in Europe and struck by the number of coins the euro uses. They have 2 euro, 1 euro, 50 cent, 20 cent, 10 cent, 5 cent, 2 cent and 1 cent coins. This got me thinking: If Riddler Nation needed to make change (anywhere from 0.01 to 0.99) and was establishing its own mint, what values of coins would be ideal to yield the smallest number of coins in any transaction? When picking values, let’s say we’re ditching the Europeans and limiting our mint to four different coin denominations — replacing the current common American ones of penny, nickel, dime and quarter.

## Note:

The combination generation code comes from a modified version of [https://github.com/notnil/combos], released under the MIT license.  It is in turn an implementation of the algorithm described at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination].

The coin-making problem's solution is described in detail at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change-making_problem#Methods_of_solving], and the solutions to this particular problem have already been published at [https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02984830].
